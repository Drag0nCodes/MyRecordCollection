Records can be added to your collection by: 
 1. Searching for them on the Find New Records page
 2. Importing a Discogs collection
 3. Importing a MRC collection
 4. Creating a custom record

1. The Find New Records page uses the Last.fm API to get record information and a cover photo and then uses the MediaWiki API to get suggested tags from Wikipedia. The suggested tags are the records genres. 

2. See Discogs tab for information.

3. Importing a MRC collection is simple. To export a collection, simply select Settings > Export MRC Collection, and then choose a folder that your collection will be exported to. Then, to import a collection, select Settings > Import MRC Collection, and choose the folder that your collection was exported to. 

4. To create a custom record, select "Create Custom Record" on the My Collection page. You can then edit it to make it your own by right-clicking the record in your collection and selecting Edit. 

Records in your collection can be given tags and a rating to help you sort and filter through your collection and decide what you want to listen to next. To edit a record, right-click it and select Edit. To change a records cover, you must have the new cover downloaded on your computer. After you add it to the record, you can safely delete the cover file.

You can also use the Pick a Record For Me button to randomly select a record to listen to based on the records currently displayed in the My Collection list.
