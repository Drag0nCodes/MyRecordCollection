Records can be added to your collection by searching for them on the Find New Records page or by importing them from a Discogs Collection. The Find New Records page uses the Last.fm API to get record information and cover photo and then uses the MediaWiki API to get suggested tags. 

Records in your collection can then be given tags and a rating to help you sort and filter through your collection and decide what you want to listen to next.

You can also use the Pick a Record For Me button to randomly select a record to listen to based on the records currently displayed in the My Collection list.
