Records in your collection can be given tags, a rating, a release year, and an added date to help you sort and filter through your collection and decide what you want to listen to next. To edit a record, right-click it and select Edit. To change a records cover, you must have the new cover downloaded on your computer. After you add the cover to the record, you can safely delete the cover image file.

You can also use the Pick a Record For Me button to randomly select a record to listen to based on the records currently displayed in the My Collection list.

Records can be added to your collection by: 
 1. Searching for them on the Find New Records page
 2. Importing a Discogs collection
 3. Importing a MRC collection
 4. Creating a custom record

1. The Find New Records page uses the Last.fm API to get record information and a cover photo and then uses the MediaWiki API to get suggested tags from Wikipedia and its release date. The suggested tags are the record's genres. 

2. See Discogs tab for information.

3. Importing a MRC collection is simple. To export a collection, simply select Settings > Export MRC Collection, and then choose a folder that your collection will be exported to. Then, to import a collection, select Settings > Import MRC Collection, and choose the folder that your collection was exported to. This will add all records in the export to your collection including their covers and tags.

4. To create a custom record, select "Create Custom Record" on the My Collection page. The edit popup will appear allowing you to edit the record and make it your own.
