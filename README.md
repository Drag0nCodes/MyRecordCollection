## Usage

**Getting the App Running**

To just use the app, you can keep only the relevant "My Record Collection-xxx" folder for your operating system. Then, just run the MyRecordCollection-vx.x.x file. Optionally, create a shortcut to this file and place it where you want.

**Modifying the App**

To modify and complie the code, use [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and open the CMakeLists.txt file. Build the project and move/copy the "resources" folder from "other files" to the build folder. Then the project can be run and a "user data" folder will be created in the build's resources folder automatically.

**Tutorial**

The application provides help information in the Menu Bar > Help > About. This information can also be found as text files in the "other files > resources > about text" folder.
